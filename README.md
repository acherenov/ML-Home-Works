First Notebook linregHW1 contains my attempt at building regression via forward selection, based on feature importance taken from tree model. However, the overall result is not satisfactory, probably due to the lack of factors. 

Second notebook alternativeHW1 containts my work with backward seletion (via Lasso regression).
